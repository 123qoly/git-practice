                <p>No one gets it right the first time. Just keep practicing. Repetition is the key.</p>

                <p>Make tons of mistakes. Solving problems and fixing mistakes the best way to save to memory!<p>

                <h4>Step away from frustration.</h4>
                <p>Being frustrated doesn't help get through issues. Just take a few minutes for a break or a walk.
