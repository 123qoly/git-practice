                <h4>Keep doing it --daily!</h4>
                    <p>Learning something new feels unnatural. It's hard. Like learning to walk. The way forward is to keep doing it over and over, every single day, even just a little, and it will slowly start to feel natural. Just do it every day even if it feels pointless, eventually it won't.
