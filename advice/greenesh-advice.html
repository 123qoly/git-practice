                <h4>Coding <em>is</em> for you.</h4>
                <p>From the outside looking in, tech seems like an entirely different universe. 
                    A different <span>galaxy</span>, even! 
                    So when we realize we're actually considering joining the tech industry, it feels 
                    a lot like going out of space, with no experience, while on a shuttle
                    with Neil Armstrong and an extraterrestrial who's been piloting ships since age 14em^2
                    (sixteen in human years)</p>

                <p>However, everything you know <span>today</span> is something you've 
                    had to learn at some point. Think about something you taught someone, whether
                    recently or a long time ago. At one point, that thing was new to you too! </p>            


                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
