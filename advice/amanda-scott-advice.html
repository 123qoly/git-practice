                <h4>Network and learn from other web developers!!</h4>
                <p>If you do not already have social media accounts, get them!  Networking with other web developers will 
                    provide you with knowledge you cannot always get from the Internet or books.  Learning from others 
                    experiences and knowledge will have a profound effect on your development in web design.
                </p>

                <h4>Never fear, Google is near!</h4>
                <p>Google is a huge reference for any and all coding, styling, and troubleshooting questions you may have
                    or situations you may encounter.  <em>Google is your friend, don't forget that!</em>
                </p>

                <h4>Skillcrush is where it is at!</h4>
                <p>I've been able to learn a lot from Skillcrush so far.  They have made it easy to understand the material 
                    and learn best practices for when I venture into the world to make my own way in the crazy world of web
                    development.  Find your sweet spot for learning the language and type of development you are most 
                    interested in and stick with it.  <strong>DON'T GIVE UP!</strong>
