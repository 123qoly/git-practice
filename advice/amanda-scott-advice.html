                <h4>Don't stop believing in yourself!</h4>
                <p>Some days you are going to feel on top of the world.  You will feel like you can do anything because everything is going right.
                    Inevitably, something will go wrong and you'll get stuck.  Just remember this is temporary. Ask for help, if needed.  Just don't
                    give up!  You can master whatever challenge you put your mind to.  And there are lots of people out there willing to help you
                    on your journey to success!</p>
                <h4>Rely on others when you need encouragement!</h4>
                <p>I highly recommend you jump on Twitter and get connected with the web development community! There are so many talented
                    and caring inviduals out there willing to help anyone and everyone.  They are willing to offer advice and provide a
                    great deal of knowledge on any topic you need help with.  It's a team effort and we are all in this together.</p>
                <h4>Finally, have FUN!</h4>
                <p>Not much else to say, except if you are not having fun then why do it?  Make each day fun and don't forget to take
                    breaks often.  It's not a race.  It will take time to get there.  HAVE FUN!</p>
