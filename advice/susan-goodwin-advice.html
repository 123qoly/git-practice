                <h4>Issues and errors are a gold mine.</h4>
                <p>You will learn so much by troubleshooting issues that come up! Every problem you solve will add to your knowledge base in a big way.</p>

                <h4>Ask for help.</h4>
                <p>Don't spend too long troubleshooting something before asking for help. Often it can be a simple typo that someone else may spot in a minute that you haven't seen while looking at it for an hour.
